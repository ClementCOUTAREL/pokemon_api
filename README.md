POKEMON API

This is an educational application to practise C# and the .net core API Framework. 

The goal is to create a simple CRUD app with the models and controllers (not the view), using the pokemon world

This Project is based on the tutorial created by Teddy Smith and published on (Youtube)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8nLSsK5NDo&list=PL82C6-O4XrHdiS10BLh23x71ve9mQCln0]
I tried to refactor some parts of the app and implement the necesary tests.
